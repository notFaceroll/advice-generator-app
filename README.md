## My process

### What I learned

This is my second project/challenge working with React, and the first time working with an API to fetch data and using it on an application.


### Continued development

Again, a lot to work on and improve. Slow but steady. Learning and getting used to see how these hooks and actually works and trying to create a solid understanding to put them in a good use.


### Useful resources

- [useFetch custom hook](https://dev.to/techcheck/custom-react-hook-usefetch-eid) - This article, written by Andrew on Dev.to, helped me understand the use of a custom hook for fetching data. Pretty simple and on point.
